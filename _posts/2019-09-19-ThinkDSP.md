# 1. Sounds and signals

- A signal represents a quantity that varies in time.

## 1.1 Periodic signal

- basic form
- sinusoid

## 1.2. Spectral decomposition

- most important topic
  - spectral decomposition
- most important mathematical idea
  - DFT
- most important algorithm
  - FFT

### Discrete Fourier Transform

- takes a signal and produces its spectrum

### Fast Fourier Transform

- effiecient way to compute the DFT

## 1.3 Signal

- offset == radian
- framerate == sample

## 1.4 Reading and writing Waves

- aplay
  - Unix Systems

## 1.5 Spectrums

- spectrum can apply filter
  - low-pass, high-pass, band-stop

## 1.6 Wave objects

- Signal -> Wave <-> Spectrum

### Wave object

- attributes
  - ys
    - NumPy array that contains the values in the signal
  - ts
    - array of the times where the signal was evaluated or sampled
  - framerate
    - the number of samples per unit
- properties
  - start
  - end
  - duration
